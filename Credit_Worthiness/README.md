# Credit Worthiness Prediction for Credit Card Applications
## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting credit worthiness to help determine whether to approve credit card applications. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze customer data to predict if an applicant is likely to default on their credit obligations.

## Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized information about credit card applicants including:
- Demographic information
- Financial history
- Credit behavior
- Application details

## Features
# Dataset Columns

* **CODE_GENDER**: customer's gender
* **FLAG_OWN_CAR**: indicator of car ownership
* **FLAG_OWN_REALTY**: indicator of home ownership
* **CNT_CHILDREN**: number of children
* **AMT_INCOME_TOTAL**: annual income
* **NAME_INCOME_TYPE**: type of income
* **NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE**: education level
* **NAME_FAMILY_STATUS**: marital status
* **NAME_HOUSING_TYPE**: type of housing
* **DAYS_BIRTH**: number of days since birth
* **DAYS_EMPLOYED**: number of days since employment date (if positive, indicates number of days since becoming unemployed)
