# Spam Filter Project

## Project Overview

This project develops an email analysis system for ProfessionAI, focusing on identifying spam emails and performing content analysis on them.

## Features

- Spam classification using machine learning
- Topic identification in spam emails
- Semantic distance calculation between topics
- Organization extraction from non-spam emails


## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing email text for analysis
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding email content distribution
3. Feature Engineering: Creating word embeddings and text features
4. Model Training: Using logistic regression to classify spam
5. Topic Modeling: Identifying main topics within spam emails

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Natural Language Processing techniques
- Word embeddings for semantic analysis
